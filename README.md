### Summary
With 13+ years of experience as a Business Analyst, Business Intelligence professional, Product Owner, and Scrum Master, I have successfully contributed to numerous banking and financial projects, ensuring seamless alignment between business and technical requirements. My background encompasses business process analysis, system design, requirements gathering, and UAT coordination, coupled with advanced proficiency in tools like Jira, Confluence, SQL, and Excel.

I am passionate about driving Agile initiatives and supporting cross-functional teams in delivering high-quality, timely solutions. My certifications, including SAFe, ICagile ICP-ACC, PSPO 1, CSPO, Advanced PSM 2, and CSM, have equipped me with a robust understanding of Agile frameworks, helping me foster collaboration and ensure project success within scope, time, and budget.

I possess a deep understanding of banking workflows, regulatory requirements, and financial systems, particularly in the context of Investment Banking (IB) trading activities. This, combined with my expertise in financial products, enables me to contribute to the effective management and delivery of complex projects in highly regulated environments.

I’m results-oriented, dedicated, and adaptable—able to work independently or as part of a team. My ability to engage effectively with stakeholders, including Credit, Operations, Front Office, Legal, and Product Controllers, has been a key factor in my success. Additionally, I actively participate in system defect identification, UAT testing, and business requirement discussions, always ensuring the highest level of attention to detail and quality standards.

Let’s connect and explore how I can bring my techno-functional expertise to your team!
