### Summary
With 13+ years of experience as a Business Analyst, Business Intelligence professional, Product Owner, and Scrum Master, I have successfully contributed to numerous banking and financial projects, ensuring seamless alignment between business and technical requirements. My background encompasses business process analysis, system design, requirements gathering, and UAT coordination, coupled with advanced proficiency in tools like Jira, Confluence, SQL, and Excel.

I am passionate about driving Agile initiatives and supporting cross-functional teams in delivering high-quality, timely solutions. My certifications, including SAFe, ICagile ICP-ACC, PSPO 1, CSPO, Advanced PSM 2, and CSM, have equipped me with a robust understanding of Agile frameworks, helping me foster collaboration and ensure project success within scope, time, and budget.

This, combined with my expertise in financial products, enables me to contribute to the effective management and delivery of complex projects in highly regulated environments.

I’m results-oriented, dedicated, and adaptable—able to work independently or as part of a team.
